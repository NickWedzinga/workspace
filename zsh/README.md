# Z shell

Z shell (or zsh) is a customizable shell often used with Oh My Zsh. Zsh is the default shell on macOS starting from Catalina (10.15).

We recommend using it together with [Oh My Zsh][omz] along with the plugins, aliases, functions and themes described within this README. Please install Oh My Zsh [here][omz] before continueing further down.

We provide the Zsh config we use [here][zshrc], we recommend you override your .zshrc with this file. Don't forget to source the .zshrc after changing any of these settings to update the shell.

## Plugins

You can find many more plugins in the [awesome zsh plugins](https://github.com/unixorn/awesome-zsh-plugins#plugins) repository, but the ones below are the ones we recommend.

Create a `plugins.zsh` under `~.oh-my-zsh/custom/`. Add the following in the file:

```bash
plugins=(git zsh-autosuggestions you-should-use z thefuck)
```

Some of these require specific installations, you can find those instructions below along with information about each plugin.

### git

Install: This plugin is pre-installed in .oh-my-zsh.

This plugin adds useful aliases related to git actions such as `gst`instead of `git status`. You can see all the alises by running `alias`.

### [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)

Install: This plugin is not installed by default and needs to be installed by you. This will install it in your `.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/` directory which gets picked up by default.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

In order for the highlight to wrap every widget it needs to be sourced last in the zshrc.
You can either just use our [.zshrc][zshrc] or add it manually to your own .zshrc with:

```bash
echo "source ${(q-)PWD}/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh" >> ${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zshrc

```

This plugin adds useful syntax highlighting to your commands as you type them, like red for aliases that are not recognized and green for ones that are. Among many other highlights.
